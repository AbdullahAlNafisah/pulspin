## **Project: Pulspin**

**Subhead:** _FPGA-Driven Current Control for Benchtop Halbach NMR_

### **Overview**

Pulspin is an integrated hardware and digital control platform designed for high-precision ** (Hydrogen) NMR** and magnetic field analysis. By leveraging a high-speed **FPGA** and a custom **current coil driver**, the system achieves the temporal and magnetic stability required for benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance.

### **Core Technologies**

- **Magnetic Source:** Utilizes a **Halbach array** configuration to generate a highly uniform, "one-sided" magnetic flux, ideal for compact, portable NMR applications.
- **Digital Control:** An **FPGA-based** architecture manages real-time RF pulse generation and high-speed data acquisition, ensuring nanosecond-level precision for spin manipulation.
- **Current Driver:** A precision-engineered coil driver provides the stability and power necessary to modulate magnetic fields and trigger **Larmor precession** in hydrogen nuclei.
- **Measurement:** Integrated magnetic field sensing allows for real-time calibration and feedback, compensating for environmental fluctuations to maintain resonance.

### **Application**

The project aims to lower the barrier to magnetic resonance research by providing a modular, benchtop solution for chemical analysis, material science, and educational physics.
